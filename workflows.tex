Custom and more sophisticated tasks can be carried out from scratch.
Crowdflower provides an interface for users to edit CrowdFlower Markup Language (CML), CSS and custom JavaScript that runs once on page load.
There is a possibility to inject custom HTML code as well.
The platform automatically inserts test question and evaluates contributors based on them.
CML and JavaScript are essential for utilizing Crowdflower's quality control

CML handles basic input controls that are necessary to utilize Crowdflower's quality control. % and crowdsourcing interfaces for named entity annotations 

It is best suited for the tasks that can not be automated and further split into smaller subtasks.
It is desirable that the tasks are as simple as possible to eliminate errors resulting from the lack of knowledge or misinterpretation.

However, repeated labeling is costly and may tend to be comparable in costs to the in-house solution.
CrowdFlower offers the option of screening users via quiz that takes place beforehand to determine quality of the worker.
