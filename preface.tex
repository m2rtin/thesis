Providing information to consumers is a common task, usually solved by implementing a web page or a mobile application.
An alternative to these approaches is a spoken dialogue system.
It allows people to interact with a computer in the most natural way, by voice.
Spoken dialogue system is intuitive, direct and hands-free, which renders an opportunity for deployment in many fields.
There is no need to find a mobile device and enter the queries into a puzzling interface, it is enough to simply say it.
It may serve as a valuable asset for obtaining information for the elderly and especially for blind people and people with visual impairment \cite{blind}. %it addresses larger spectrum of people, convenient source of information

However, it is very difficult to implement a dialogue system from ground up.
Fortunately the \acf{ASDF} \cite{asdf} incorporates all of the key components needed for performing the task.
We decided to take the advantage of \ac{ASDF} and implement a spoken dialogue system in English for providing \acf{PTINY}.
New York, is a city with the highest ridership in the United States and with one of the most extensive subway systems in the world. %thus it presents a formidable challenge.
English benefits from wider range of use and larger competition to be compared with.
This enables us to build better systems with greater potential.

\acf{ASR} is not yet at the point where every utterance could be reliably identified by a computer \cite{asr}.
However, it is possible to achieve substantially better results by using a speech recognizer within a restricted domain.
A crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower is used to evaluate our \ac{PTI} solution and to collect speech data.
The collected speech data is used to train a Kaldi speech recognizer and it is compared to the Google \ac{ASR}.
The comparison measures are based on the subjective user satisfaction of CrowdFlower contributors. % deliberation testimony

Our \ac{PTI} solution is a useful showcase of the \ac{ASDF} and will further contribute to collect speech data for improving the quality of speech recognizers. It will also participate in the \ac{MTA} App Quest competition.

The main results of this thesis are the public transport information phone-based dialogue system for New York (\ac{PTINY}) and a Kaldi decoder for English speech recognition.

This thesis is organized as follows.
In the first chapter we look at the used technologies.
In the second chapter we discuss the implementation in its principles by each component. %at a time
The third chapter covers the features of the implemented solution and displays its capabilities.
The fourth chapter describes the workflows associated with creating a dialogue system along with training language model and building a Kaldi decoder.
In the fifth chapter we compare the Kaldi \ac{ASR} with the cloud-base \ac{ASR} by Google and summarize the findings.




% telephone-based spoken dialog system

% The development of dialogue systems makes possible more natural human-computer interaction.
% The dialogue systems have prospects to be increasingly utilized at robotics and for providing information.
% Spoken dialogue systems are being used more frequently for their potential in numerous applications at many different fields.
% Spoken dialogue systems allow a user to interact with a computer using voice as the primary communication medium.

% They are being used for loan establishment, car rental, call rate adjustment etc.
% They may serve for the purposes of renting a car, establishing loans, or changing telephone rates, rezervace hotelu.


% Besides, there is a reason why in every other sci-fi movie, characters communicate with computers solely via voice. It is easy (simple?).

%INTRODUCTION:

% What is a dialogue system
% Introduction to the problematics
% It is important
% method selection
% what has been done
% what has not been done
% what do we want to display in our work
% apt definition of the goals of this work

%This work is concerned with this and that, the assumptions are these, we would also want to use crowd sourcing for leaning something which enables this and that, then we evaluate


% What is interesting on this thesis: 
%  - It utilizes voice interface for obtaining information.
% Who could utilize output of this thesis:
%  - MTA for sure
% What output could be marked as surprising:
%  - we was able to achieve a comparable results with google TTS.
% What am i most proud of?
%  - The fact that we were able to participate in an MTA contest with a good competitive solution.
% If someone should continue my work - what parts should have he used and what should have he rewritten.
%  - He should use the whole solution, bus he would have to rewrite a SLU and HDC a bit for better handling of the streets and stuff
% What have I learned during the process, who could be interested:
%  - For sure the companies that make similar applications for different domains could be interested.
%  - The ones that want to use ADSF for development of their own dialogue system
%  - I have learned a great deal about dialogue systems, working with crowd sourcing etc.
