\section{Alex framework - PTICS}

The Alex Dialogue System Framework (ADSF) is used for utilizing research in the development of spoken dialogue systems.
ADSF is maintained by the dialogue systems group at UFAL \cite{ufal}, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague.
This framework is in Python.

The ADSF consists of baseline components for assembling spoken dialogue systems.
There are tools for processing logs and evaluating spoken dialogue systems.
These tools can be used for audio transcriptions for example.
A small set of example implementations for different domains is also present.

%We will introduce individual components in detail later in this section.
\todo{There may be another paragraph about PTICS ?}

\subsection{Automatic Speech Recognition}

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transforms spoken words into text.
Many applications already use ASR technology as an interface between computer and person, although it is not yet capable of understanding all speech in any environment.
Many factors influence perception of voice. Acoustic conditions, voice differences, distance from recording device, heavy accents even voice emphasis, these are few of the issues versatile ASR has to cope with.
Achieving better quality requires great many hours of transcribed text, which is hard to come by.
However, when we restrict ourselves to a specific domain, the scope of words becomes quite limited.
There is only so many expressions that can be used in a common conversation about particular subject.
Therefore better results can be achieved.

\subsubsection{Kaldi}

Kaldi is an open-source \footnote{Apache License 2.0} toolkit for speech recognition based on finite state transducers commonly used among researchers.
We use python wrapper Pykaldi within the ADSF.

\todo{Process of training and testing Kaldi models will be explained in chapter [whoKnows].}

\subsubsection{Google}

Google has its own cloud solution of ASR which is used by Google command and Google Translate.

\subsubsection{Voice Activity Detection}

In order to send a voice track to ASR processing, we need to be able to cut speech into logical units (sentences).
This role is performed by the Voice Activity Detection (VAD).

\subsection{Text To Speech}

There are also variety of TTS providers. ADSF supports Flite, VoiceRSS and Google.

\subsection{Dialogue Manager}

\todo{it has to keep inner states for knowing the context, it is the soul of dialogue system}

\subsection{VoIP interface}

\section{Crowdsourcing}

Crowdsourcing is a method for acquiring data by delegating work to a community of people.
In particular online communities tend to be employed for convenience.
By dividing tasks into smaller independent parts, one can eliminate the need for expert workers and therefore reduce costs associated with acquisition of the coveted data.
In some cases the cost savings can be a tenfold of what in-house solution may provide \cite{Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk} % offer
However, this method can hardly achieve the quality or accuracy of expert workers. 

There are several crowdsourcing platforms connecting workers with work requesters such as Amazon Mechanical Turk \footnote{\url{https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome}}, Samasource \footnote{\url{http://samasource.org/}}, CrowdFlower and many more.
Samasource is a non-profit organization with a noble cause of lifting people out of poverty through digital work.
It does not, however, meet our need of employing native English speakers.
While Amazon Mechanical Turk would meet our requirements, it is no longer available for non-US requesters.
With Crowdflower, we are able to implement a custom solution directly within the platform.

Crowdflower has mechanisms such as monitoring answer distributions and computing confidence score for maintaining quality of the output data. % that yield good quality assurance. the assurance of quality
They claim great amount of contributor force which promises prompt job resolution. % wide range 
The platform contains comprehensible templates for common tasks.
It features interface for building a custom job from scratch with a sensible support and demonstrative examples, too % in form of examples, too.
